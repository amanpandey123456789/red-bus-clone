The Redbus project typically refers to creating a clone of the Redbus website or building a
bus booking platform similar to the popular Redbus service. Redbus is an online platform 
that provides bus ticket booking services.It is widely used in India and offers users the 
ability to search for buses, compare prices, select seats, and make reservations for travel.

In the context of a Redbus clone project, the goal is to replicate the user interface (UI) and
design of the Redbus website to demonstrate your front-end development skills, particularly
in HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.
